# The-Holy-Grail

Python project for code louisville

This project should be able to be run easily through the python shell in the standered way. No special instructions for operation.

Type "begin" to start. If the you reach an ending you can type "begin" to restart the adventure.

For this project I have:

1. A master loop that alows you to play again.

2. At least three function with one of them returning something used on the program.

3. Several lists populated with values and retrieved to be used in the program.

4. Possibly a text analysis to display information.
